## Introduction 🚀

sejm-stats is a project aimed at improving the accessibility of parliamentary information for everyone. The official parliamentary website is not very user-friendly and lacks some key features, such as keyword search. sejm-stats aims to fix these issues and add some additional features.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind sejm-stats is to make parliamentary information more accessible to everyone. The project is not driven by financial motives, but rather by the desire to keep everyone informed about what's happening in the country. sejm-stats is not affiliated with any political party. The goal is to provide objective and convenient information to help citizens understand the decision-making processes in our country. However, as the project developed, it became clear that some form of financing would be necessary to keep it going.
